Write a function that takes a string which has integers inside it separated by spaces, and your task is to convert each integer in the string into an integer and return their sum.

Example
summy("1 2 3")  ==> 6

solutions


def summy(string_of_ints):
    string2 = string_of_ints.strip().split(' ')
    res = len(string2)
    sum_of_ints = 0
    
    for i, s in enumerate(string2):
        if s!= ' ':
            sum_of_ints = sum_of_ints + int(s)
    
    return sum_of_ints
